A beginner repositoryto learn how to use Github

Hello, Chuka here. This is my intro to Github. 
I'm simply testing out the functionality of this "commit system" and testing out my "improved" typing skills due to touch typing. For some reason I keep making typos, especially when I type the letters: u,i,o,p, and ,y.

This line was added from a new branch. Still practicing using the commit and pull funtionality.
